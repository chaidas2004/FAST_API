 I started by installing FastAPI and Uvicorn, which lay the groundwork for intiliaizng a web application. It was pretty simple in terms of synaticl features because python is not that demanding and its flexible in nature.  The simplicity and intuitiveness of FastAPI surprised me, well actually its in the name FAST, it cuts the bullshit and auto generates features for efficency. It made me think about how much web development has become simplified, enabling me to focus more on creating functionalities rather than nitpicking at the framework itself.

Fast API is not really just about connecting systems; they're about creating possibilities, enabling applications to communicate, share data, and extend functionalities beyond what is given.

Understanding JSON through FastAPI was like learning a universal language that simplifies data exchange over the web.  The introduction to creating more endpoints, utilizing GET methods, and playing around with path and query parameters was interesting, I remember the 4 main methods, PUT, POST, DELETE AND PATCH. Each endpoint is a gateway to specific functionalities, with parameters acting as guides that lead to the exact destination or data I seek.

Diving deeper into request bodies and POST methods opens more opportunties accepting data from users. It's like having a conversation where I get to listen and respond. The PUT and DELETE methods further extended this dialogue, allowing me to update or remove information, maintaining the dynamism and relevance of the data in my application.

FAST API is really convient and inutitive to say the least, although Ive had only an hour of exposure, its a blueprint and thats how you get started.
